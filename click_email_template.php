	<h2>Greeting, <?php echo $name ?>!</h2>

	<p>Thanks for being a loyal BizGym user. We greatly appreciate you’re sticking with us through our beta ride. And if you’re one of those who contributed thoughts to our new 2.0 release, huge thanks for helping shape the future of business tools!</p>

	<p>Since our beta launch a couple years ago, we’ve done a great deal of learning on what users really want. We’ve also learned how to structure data in new ways and how to apply new data management tools. BizGym 2.0 is therefore a complete refactoring of our backend system which empowers us to create new features now and be positioned for long-term growth.</p>

	<h3>New 2.0 Features</h3>
	<p>With this release, we’re excited to introduce a number of new features including:</p>

	<p><strong>Marketplace, the new “app store” of business tools and templates.</strong> All of the familiar tools 	from BizGym 1.0 will be auto-loaded to your new 2.0 account. The only exception is the Financial Forecasting Tool Set which is now a separate app in Marketplace. Once logged into 2.0, you can visit Marketplace to install Financial Forecasting.</p>

	<p><strong>BizGenics™ Data, a new way of holding your company story.</strong> This system powers all Marketplace Templates and also provides a way for business experts to author templates for distribution in the Marketplace.</p>

	<p><strong>Company Subscriptions, a new approach to project flexibility.</strong> This is a departure from our 1.0 individual membership format where users paid individually, opened company projects and invited other users to collaborate on projects. In 2.0, we instead offer company subscriptions so the company story stays with the company in the event that a key employee leaves. On the employee (individual user) end, personal profiles are now provided free so if you move companies, your personal bio and badges go with you.</p>

	<p><strong>Transferring Project Data</strong>
	<br>BizGym 1.0 and 2.0 are very different data structures so automated project data transfer is not easily feasible. Thus, we offer two options to transferring your BizGym 1.0 project data to the new 2.0 system:</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0"> 
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="80px"><strong>1. You Do It:</strong></td>
        <td>Open a new free account at BizGym 2.0 and manually transfer your 1.0 data yourself at no cost.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="80px"><strong>2. We Do It:</strong></td>
        <td>Open a new annual pay membership at BizGym 2.0 and we’ll transfer your project data for you as part of the new subscription. When you open your new account, just complete Project Transfer section.</td>
    </tr>
</table>  

<p><strong>1.0 Project Archive</strong>
<br>Whether or not your open and transfer data into 2.0, you’ll still be able to access your 1.0 projects at https://archive.bizgym.com until January 1, 2016.</p>
